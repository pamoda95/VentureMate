Venture Mate is an android application that helps users to find new locations for adventurous journeys within Sri Lanka. It includes interesting places for hiking, camping, safaris, cycling, rock climbing, rafting and for other venturesome activities. The application originally includes many such places under different categories for the users to explore. Under each place, it includes a description of the place together with its location,  seasons to visit, different routes to reach there, current weather condition and many more details that are useful to the travellers which are kept within a cloud database. The users also can look for such places around his/her current location as well. Other than that once a user visits a place he/she can rate the place with their own experiences and also give a review on the place. Then other users can ask for more details from them by replying to their reviews and clear the doubts they have regarding the place or the journey. Moreover, once a user visits a place that is not available in the application or even the places that are quite interesting but not included in maps,  he/she can add such places under certain criteria. Users also can contact other users who have already visited and get information from them.  To do all these activities, the user should be registered within the application.
